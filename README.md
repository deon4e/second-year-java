## Syllabus
### Unix and Introduction to the Lab: Prof H Suleman
Practical work will be done on Unix. In preparation for this, there will be 
4 lectures that will introduce students to this operating system as 
installed in the lab. A quick introduction to the version control system Git will also be given; some practical assignments will require its use.

### Data Structures 1: Prof H Suleman
Analysis of Algorithms: We will discuss how to express the running times of algorithms in a way that enables us to distinguish an efficient algorithm from an inefficient one. Trees (general, binary, AVL, red-back): We will study tree data structures, their applications, their algorithms and various techniques for ensuring their efficiency. We will end by
studying Hash Tables in order to learn how to store large amounts of data in ways that are relatively easy to index and search.

### Data Structures 2: A/Prof S Berman
Searching must sometimes be done in terms of priority. Priority queues ensure that the information is always ordered so that the information with the highest priority is easily accessible. This is a good thing because retrieval can occur in constant time. Priority queues, and also B-tree indexes, will be studied. On a final note, we will discuss some graph
algorithms because indexing and searching operations typically do not occur independently but rather as a sequence. It is therefore important to find ways of doing so optimally. For each of the data structures, we will discuss their pros and cons, as well as application examples for which each one is best suited.

### Databases: A/Prof S Berman
This module aims to develop an understanding of what makes a good database and an awareness of the issues in
database manag
